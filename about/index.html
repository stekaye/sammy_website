  <div class="about-wrapper">
    <div class="about-copy">
      <h1 class="-about-copy-title">About Me</h1>
      <p class="-about-copy-text">
        I am a coach, facilitator & consultant with nearly a decade’s experience supporting individuals & organisations to develop and grow. I wear many hats, but ‘nurturing potential’ sits at the centre of all the work I do, whether this is coaching individuals one-on-one, designing and delivering training programmes, consulting for education-focused NGOs or schools, or teaching children & young people.
      </p>
      <p class="-about-copy-text">
        My background is in education – I am a fully qualified secondary school maths & economics teacher, and I spent several years teaching in the UK and Cambodia. I held the role of Curriculum Leader for 2 years, during which I managed a team of teachers, and was responsible for their professional development, including the mentoring of trainee or newly qualified teachers. I implemented changes in the department, always geared towards two outcomes; improving the morale and productivity of my team, and improving outcomes & opportunities for our students.
      </p>
      <p class="-about-copy-text">
        I have spent the past 5 years out of the classroom, working as a consultant for Educational NGOs in South East Asia and Africa, and as a coach for individuals in and out of the workplace. As a consultant, my role has included offering strategic advice, as well as producing training materials, and delivering professional development & coaching to staff within the organisations. I strongly believe that having a coaching culture rather than a directive/instructional culture in all organisations is key to transformative change and long-term success, with NGOs being no exception. In fact, with large cultural and contextual barriers to overcome between those in HQ and those working at a local level, coaching is even more impactful.
      </p>
      <p class="-about-copy-text">
        As a coach, I have worked with individuals mostly on their career & professional development ambitions, challenges and getting ‘unstuck’ in this area of their life. This has led to discussion and exploration around a diverse range of other themes including confidence, self-belief, finding meaning/purpose, skills development, decision-making, communication, relationship challenges, managing stress, work-life balance, finance, health, and major life transitions.
      </p>
      <p class="-about-copy-text">
        I believe my experience working with different people from diverse backgrounds is the most crucial to my work, but as there is always an interest in qualifications, I will include these here:
        <ul>
          <li>Undergraduate degree from the University of Cambridge in Economics & Land Economy (MA:Hons)</li>
          <li>Postgraduate degree from UCL in Education & International Development (MA:Hons)</li>
          <li>PGCE from UCL Institute of Education in Mathematics</li>
          <ul>Coach Certification from Bailey Balfour (ICF-accredited programme at ACC level).</ul>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p class="-about-copy-text">
        I have personally faced and overcome many of the challenges my clients face, including trauma, chronic health challenges, anxiety, low self-confidence, perfectionism, people-pleasing and fear of failure. A major health diagnosis in my mid-20s caused me to re-evaluate my life and career; in particular, what I consider to be a ‘successful life’. As a result, along with the support of friends, therapists and coaches, I have recalibrated myself and my life from the ground up, and now lead a much happier, healthier life in the beautiful city of Barcelona. Personal growth, though, is a lifelong journey, and I am always learning, asking questions, and continue to seek support from others to make these changes.
