      <strong>What I do as a coach is to challenge people to consider what “success” means to them, and what it would look like to be someone and have a life that would be meaningful to them.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      My work with teenage clients is very specific to the individual and what challenges they are facing in their lives. I coach on a wide variety of topics, covering themes such as confidence, self-belief, relationship challenges, managing stress, exam preparation, health, and major life transitions.

    </p>
    <p>
      Through one-on-one structured conversations, deep listening, powerful questions, and insight, I help my clients figure out for themselves exactly what they want, and the steps they need to take to get there. Sometimes this is about gaining clarity, exploring and reflecting. Sometimes it's about planning concrete actions to reach specific goals. Often it's a combination of both. But <strong>the agenda and direction of travel is always set entirely by the client, not by me</strong>.​
    </p>
    <p>
      The process looks different for everyone, but ultimately, whatever is significant and meaningful to the individual will determine the direction of travel our coaching relationship will take. Every client I work with has different challenges, desires, goals, and a different definition of ‘success’. Coaching is all about you as the individual, the way they think, the support they need, and the values and beliefs they hold.
    </p>

      <strong>I have nearly a decade of experience working with young people</strong>, as a qualified teacher in the UK, a coach, mentor, tutor, and as a consultant for international NGOs in low income countries and contexts. I have been fortunate enough to have had incredible opportunities to support the personal growth & development of the young people I have worked with throughout this time. One-on-one coaching is one of the most successful and effective ways I have found to support individuals, and therefore <strong>I hope I get the opportunity to work with you and your child</strong>.

      <h1>My Coaching Style</h1>
      <p>
        As a coach, I am open, warm and positive, though I am not afraid to ask tough questions and make observations that other people may be too scared to make.
      </p>
      <p>
        I take a deep-dive approach to help my clients figure out what makes them tick, what makes them feel alive and what makes them happy, and then to give them the support to find their voice and the steps it will take to get them to that place.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sessions provide a safe space where my clients feel able to explore their thoughts and ideas completely without judgement. I take an intuitive approach, digging deep when appropriate to get to the heart of underlying issues and limiting beliefs or assumptions. I like to challenge my clients; to ask tough questions and offer observations aimed to improve their awareness.
      </p>
      <p >
        The foundation of my work, though, is genuine empathy and care for my clients, and a willingness to help them discover new things and move forward into the future they create for themselves.

      <h1>My Commitment to You</h1>
      <p>
        If I take your child on as a new client, you can count on my ongoing and dedicated support, not just during our face-to-face sessions, but throughout the process. This will look different for everyone, and their specific needs and outcomes, but it could be staying in touch by email, having check-in calls on the weeks without coaching, sharing recommendations of books, podcasts, articles and so on. A lot of the work for both me as a coach and your child as a client takes place between the sessions. I will never take on a client who I feel is not in the right space to benefit from coaching, or who I think would work better with a different coach.      </p>
