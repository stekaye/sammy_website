      <h3>What is coaching?</h3>
      <p>
        At its heart, coaching is about helping people reach their potential, to be the best versions of themselves more of the time. It is a partnership between coach and client, where through structured, intuitive conversations, deep listening and powerful questions, the client is able to explore what it is they want (or want to overcome), and how they can move towards that.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s all about helping people say ‘I want to be and do more. I want to ask myself the scary questions and shake things up. I want to explore the possibility of pursuing my real dream; the dream I’m scared to admit to.’
      </p> 
      <p>
        Each coaching conversation is a safe space where the client can reflect and recognise their own ability to identify their greatest needs and desires, and the tools to work towards these.

      <h3>Would I benefit from coaching?</h3>
      <p>
        Anyone who is ready to take steps to move towards their potential, in themselves, in their work and in their lives, would benefit greatly from coaching.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coaching is a powerful and highly effective form of personal & professional development, but it only works if the client is in the right mindset to do the hard work and the (sometimes scary) self-exploration.
      </p> 
      <p>
        If you have an open mind, the desire to create meaningful life, a willingness to explore, and the drive to take action, you will benefit enormously from coaching.

      <h3>How do I know if you are the right coach for me?</h3>
      <p>
        The best way to answer this is by <strong>reaching out to me</strong> so we can arrange a free first coaching session. That way we can talk and discover whether we are the right fit for a coaching relationship.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also read my testimonials to get an idea of the kind of work my clients and I do.
      </p> 
      <p>
        One client described my coaching as most ideal for “someone ‘stuck in a rut’ or a little directionless who would like to find their path; someone who would like to dive deep into a particular topic and unpick it, particularly if they find themselves in repetitive situations that they don’t seem to gain clarity over.”

      <h3>How would coaching work?</h3>
      <p>
        I offer a variety of packages, which can be altered to fit your needs. The minimum commitment from you to work with me is 6 sessions; even though each session we will have powerful conversations, and you will learn something new about yourself, real change takes time.
      </p>
      <p>
        My coaching sessions usually last between 1.5 and 2 hours, so we can explore and dig deep. They can take place online or face-to-face (in Barcelona only).
      </p> 
      <p>
        Normally, sessions take place a couple of times a month. However, again this can be tailored to you – some people prefer sessions more often, and others less.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to find out more specifics on the logistics and various coaching packages, <strong>get in touch with me</strong> for a free coaching session so I can better understand if we are the right fit, and what it would require to get you to where you want to be.

      <h3>What are your fees?</h3>
      <p>
        Each client has different needs and requirements from the coaching process, so I have a number of packages available, with different time scales & financial commitments. The best way for me to identify the right package for you is for us to speak, either by phone or Skype/Zoom. This first session is always free; it will give you a chance to really experience coaching, and will create the opportunity for both of us to see if we are the right fit.
