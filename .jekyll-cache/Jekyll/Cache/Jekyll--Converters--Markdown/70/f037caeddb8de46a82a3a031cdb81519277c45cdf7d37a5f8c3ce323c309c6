I"é<p>I am a coach, facilitator &amp; consultant with nearly a decadeâ€™s experience supporting individuals &amp; organisations to develop and grow. I wear many hats, but â€˜nurturing potentialâ€™ sits at the centre of all the work I do, whether this is coaching individuals one-on-one, designing and delivering training programmes, consulting for education-focused NGOs or schools, or teaching children &amp; young people.</p>

<p>â€‹My background is in education â€“ I am a fully qualified secondary school maths &amp; economics teacher, and I spent several years teaching in the UK and Cambodia. I held the role of Curriculum Leader for 2 years, during which I managed a team of teachers, and was responsible for their professional development, including the mentoring of trainee or newly qualified teachers. I implemented changes in the department, always geared towards two outcomes; improving the morale and productivity of my team, and improving outcomes &amp; opportunities for our students.</p>
