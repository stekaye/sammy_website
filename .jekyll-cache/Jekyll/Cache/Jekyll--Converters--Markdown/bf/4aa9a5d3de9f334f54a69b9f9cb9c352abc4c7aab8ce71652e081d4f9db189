I"©<p>I am a coach, facilitator &amp; consultant with nearly a decadeâ€™s experience supporting individuals &amp; organisations to develop and grow. I wear many hats, but â€˜nurturing potentialâ€™ sits at the centre of all the work I do, whether this is coaching individuals one-on-one, designing and delivering training programmes, consulting for education-focused NGOs or schools, or teaching children &amp; young people.</p>
