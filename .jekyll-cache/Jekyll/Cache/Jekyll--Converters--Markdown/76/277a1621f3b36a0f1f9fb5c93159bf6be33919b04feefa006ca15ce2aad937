I"¬<p>I am a coach, facilitator &amp; consultant with nearly a decadeâ€™s experience supporting individuals &amp; organisations to develop and grow. I wear many hats, but â€˜nurturing potentialâ€™ sits at the centre of all the work I do, whether this is coaching individuals one-on-one, designing and delivering training programmes, consulting for education-focused NGOs or schools, or teaching children &amp; young people.</p>

<p>â€‹My background is in education â€“ I am a fully qualified secondary school maths &amp; economics teacher, and I spent several years teaching in the UK and Cambodia. I held the role of Curriculum Leader for 2 years, during which I managed a team of teachers, and was responsible for their professional development, including the mentoring of trainee or newly qualified teachers. I implemented changes in the department, always geared towards two outcomes; improving the morale and productivity of my team, and improving outcomes &amp; opportunities for our students.</p>

<p>I have spent the past 5 years out of the classroom, working as a consultant for Educational NGOs in South East Asia and Africa, and as a coach for individuals in and out of the workplace. As a consultant, my role has included offering strategic advice, as well as producing training materials, and delivering professional development &amp; coaching to staff within the organisations. I strongly believe that having a coaching culture rather than a directive/instructional culture in all organisations is key to transformative change and long-term success, with NGOs being no exception. In fact, with large cultural and contextual barriers to overcome between those in HQ and those working at a local level, coaching is even more impactful.</p>

<p>â€‹</p>

<p>As a coach, I have worked with individuals mostly on their career &amp; professional development ambitions, challenges and getting â€˜unstuckâ€™ in this area of their life. This has led to discussion and exploration around a diverse range of other themes including confidence, self-belief, finding meaning/purpose, skills development, decision-making, communication, relationship challenges, managing stress, work-life balance, finance, health, and major life transitions.</p>

<p>I believe my experience working with different people from diverse backgrounds is the most crucial to my work, but as there is always an interest in qualifications, I will include these here:</p>

<p>â€‹</p>

<p>Undergraduate degree from the University of Cambridge in Economics &amp; Land Economy (MA:Hons)
Postgraduate degree from UCL in Education &amp; International Development (MA:Hons)
PGCE from UCL Institute of Education in Mathematics
Coach Certification from Bailey Balfour (ICF-accredited programme at ACC level).</p>

<p>I have personally faced and overcome many of the challenges my clients face, including trauma, chronic health challenges, anxiety, low self-confidence, perfectionism, people-pleasing and fear of failure. A major health diagnosis in my mid-20s caused me to re-evaluate my life and career; in particular, what I consider to be a â€˜successful lifeâ€™. As a result, along with the support of friends, therapists and coaches, I have recalibrated myself and my life from the ground up, and now lead a much happier, healthier life in the beautiful city of Barcelona. Personal growth, though, is a lifelong journey, and I am always learning, asking questions, and continue to seek support from others to make these changes.</p>
