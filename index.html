      <h1 class="callout-title">My Story</h1>
      <p>I have nearly 10 years’ experience working as a teacher, facilitator, coach, consultant and mentor, and at the heart of what I do is to help people & organisations reach their full potential. I work with those who are aspiring to make changes, whether that relates to achieving specific goals, overcoming challenges, shifting mindset, or transforming the way they live, work and operate. At the heart of what I do is to help people create meaning and impact in their lives and work. <span>Often, this means guiding them to evaluate their definition of “success” and what it looks like for them, and then, through powerful conversations and insight, helping them to move towards this.</span></p>

Working with Sammy has been truly life changing and helped me put in place techniques that even after one session, I saw a difference, not only in my spending habits, but my attitude to money in general. This has been an issue I’ve faced for many years, and have never been able to tackle it. Without her help, I would never have been able to do it alone. I am looking forward to continuing to work with her and seeing improvements in my everyday life and happiness.</span><span class="testimonial-copy-mobile">Working with Sammy has been truly life changing and helped me put in place techniques that even after one session, I saw a difference...

You won't regret it.</span><span class="testimonial-copy-mobile">While working with Samantha I have had so many light bulb and 'ah ha' moments.

She has a real talent for helping you to both work out and choose your desired direction. Her question asking is excellent. She doesn’t give up, until you really reach the crux of the matter. During every session I also feel how much Samantha enjoys her work as a coach and helping others to achieve their goals. I would wholeheartedly recommend Samantha as a coach.</span><span class="testimonial-copy-mobile">Samantha has been truly present in every coaching session I’ve had.
