          As a Professional Development coach, I offer bespoke coaching packages to businesses based on working one-to-one with individuals over an extended period on the issues they are facing. The agenda of the coaching programme can either be set by the individual themselves, by the organisation/business, or based on the results of 360 reviews, which I offer as part of the coaching package.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have experience coaching on a wide variety of topics, from communication to decision-making, from management styles to self-belief, and from client relationships to motivation. The impact this has had on my clients mirrors that of the research – coaching clients see gains in productivity, drive, and engagement with their work, and reduced stress and burnout.

      <h1>Bespoke Packages</h1>
      <p>
        Each organisation/business has unique requirements including number & job positions of employees to be coached, duration of the coaching programme, and the specific challenges to be addressed. As such, I don't offer prescribed coaching packages, but instead will design them according to your needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Potential features of the coaching package include:​
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul class="subsection-list-indent">
          <li>360 reviews</li>
          <li >Line manager meetings</li>
          <li>Goal-setting/review meetings</li>
          <li>Regular coaching sessions (usually 1-2 per month)</li>
          <li>Progress updates & final report</li>
          <li>Psychometric test integration</li>
          <li>Ongoing email support</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
