      <strong>What I do as a coach is to challenge people to consider what “success” means to them, and what it would look like to be someone and have a life that would be meaningful to them.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Through one-on-one structured conversations, deep listening, powerful questions, and insight, I help my clients figure out for themselves exactly what they want, and the steps they need to take to get there. Sometimes this is about gaining clarity, exploring and reflecting. Sometimes it's about planning concrete actions to reach specific goals. Often it's a combination of both. But the agenda and direction of travel is always set entirely by the client, not by me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of my clients come to me for Career Coaching, where I help my clients identify what their passion is, and what drives them; the work that would give them a sense of purpose and meaning. This could be about changing career completely, or about growing within their chosen field. Ultimately, it's all about increasing the proportion of time you spend doing what you love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having said that, I love working with clients on a wide variety of issues, including:
    </p>
    <p>
      Confidence, self-belief, finding one's purpose, skills development, decision-making, communication, relationship challenges, managing stress, work-life balance, finance, health, and career transitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The process looks different for everyone, but ultimately, whatever is significant and meaningful to you will determine the direction of travel our coaching relationship will take. Every client I work with has different challenges, desires, goals, and a different definition of ‘success’. Coaching is all about you as the client, the way you think, the support you need, and the values and beliefs you hold.
    </p>

      <strong>We will start exactly where you are.</strong>

      <h1>My Coaching Style</h1>
      <p>
        As a coach, I am open, warm and positive, though I am not afraid to ask tough questions and make observations that other people may be too scared to make.
      </p>
      <p>
        I take a deep-dive approach to help my clients figure out what makes them tick, what makes them feel alive and what makes them happy, and then to give them the support to find their voice and the steps it will take to get them to that place.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sessions provide a safe space where my clients feel able to explore their thoughts and ideas completely without judgement. I take an intuitive approach, digging deep when appropriate to get to the heart of underlying issues and limiting beliefs or assumptions. I like to challenge my clients; to ask tough questions and offer observations aimed to improve their awareness.
      </p>
      <p>
        The foundation of my work, though, is genuine empathy and care for my clients, and a willingness to help them discover new things and move forward into the future they create for themselves.

      <h1>My Commitment to You</h1>
      <p>
        If I take you on as a new client, you can count on my ongoing and dedicated support, not just during our face-to-face sessions, but throughout the process. This will look different for everyone, and their specific needs and outcomes, but it could be staying in touch by email, having check-in calls on the weeks without coaching, sharing recommendations of books, podcasts, articles and so on. A lot of the work for both me as a coach and you as a client takes place between the sessions. I will never take on a client who I feel is not in the right space to benefit from coaching, or who I think would work better with a different coach.
