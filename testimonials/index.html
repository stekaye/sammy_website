          While working with Samantha I have had so many light bulb and 'ah ha' moments. Not afraid to challenge you to address your deepest self-limiting beliefs, and dig into the heart of what is really driving you, Samantha's warm and collaborative style made our focused sessions enjoyable, while still providing a no nonsense approach and accountability when needed. I highly recommend her coaching to anyone who feels ready to take a leap to make a change in their lives, or who just wants to know themselves more deeply, and live their best life. You won't regret it.

          One of my biggest struggles has been my finances, not knowing how to prioritise my spending and struggling to save for my future. Working with Sammy has been truly life changing and helped me put in place techniques that even after one session, I saw a difference, not only in my spending habits, but my attitude to money in general. This has been an issue Iâ€™ve faced for many years, and have never been able to tackle it. Without her help, I would never have been able to do it alone. I am looking forward to continuing to work with her and seeing improvements in my everyday life and happiness.

          Sammy pushes you to think deeply about your issues. She asks great questions and during the course of the coaching program she made me realise that I had the answers all along. Sammy's coaching style is very supportive. I was coached by her for 6 months and this has helped me improve my life dramatically.

          Sammy has a natural way of engaging you on a personal level that allows you to feel safe to openly share your thoughts and needs. She is able to coach with a high level of care and empathy. She is encouraging and trustworthy. I love how Sammy can unleash in me new perspectives that help me see all the possibilities that I have not seen before, hence enabling me to come up with answers for myself.

          Coaching is something I have always been hesitant to do, due largely to my natural aversion to parting with money. However, when I met Sammy I knew that this was an opportunity that I would be foolish to pass up. Sammy is such a natural open, generous, patient and welcoming coach, and I felt instantly at ease. Her questions are extremely thought provoking and I was amazed at how quickly my fog began to clear once we began the journey. I came to Sammy confused, frustrated and stuck, but left clear on what brought me here and where I want to go. I learnt so much about myself and so much more from just being around Sammy and seeing her operate. I am proud to call this website my thank you to her and will always see it as symbol of the journey we took together.
